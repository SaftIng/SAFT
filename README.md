# Saft

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SaftIng/Saft.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SaftIng/Saft)

The Saft PHP framework provides RDF handling and support for Semantic Web technologies. It consists of the Saft.Library (_Saft.data_, _Saft.rdf_, _Saft.sparql_ and _Saft.store_), Saft.Additions (e.g. adapter for triple stores) and Saft.skeleton (to jump start your project).

## Current status

Saft is under development but provides [stable releases](https://github.com/SaftIng/Saft/releases) already. Its used in different scenarios and is already performing very well for our approaches and rapid prototyping. With Erfurt in the bag, we are now supporting all major Semantic Web libraries for PHP:
* Erfurt
* ARC2
* EasyRDF
* Redland

Sure, there is still work to do to refine the library, so you are very welcome to join us and help to make Saft better!
